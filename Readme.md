# Pet stores Test cases

Clone project from github location: [PetStores in Java](https://github.com/jgireesh/java_petstore_api.git/) below are the instructions

- Initialise a repository to clone
>$ cd /Users/XXXXX/petstore
> 
>git init  
> git clone https://github.com/jgireesh/java_petstore_api.git

## Once project Imported, perform a below command
>mvn clean installÂ§

- ** This will download all required dependencies required to run the test cases.

## Running Test cases

- Under petCases.java file,
- Click on Class (Run icon), that should run all the cases
- for single cases, select perticular @Test method to run.

###Note:
- I have managed to run add (Post) case using a random generated IDs, however there is always invalid method error from petstore end.
- so unsure how to deal with it, given the timelines.
- Delete also has some issues, its throwing 301 response.
- So given all these challenges, i have made these as fixed (instead of dynamic), however these can be stored in a static variable and can be used in the coming methods to verify different tests.
- similary, for javastream question, i havent found time to think and write the answer.
- Honestly, i have never used javastreams before. given a chance, i am confident can do these.

Thank you.
